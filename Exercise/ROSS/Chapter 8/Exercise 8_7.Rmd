To estimate $E[X]$, $X_1, ..., X_{16}$ have been simulated with the following values resulting: $10,11,10,10.5,11.5,14,8,13,6,15,10,11.5,10.5,12,8,16.5$. Based on these data, if we want standard deviation of the estimator of $E[X]$ to be less than $0.1$, roughly how many additional simulation runs will be needed?
```{r}
Xs <- c(10,11,10,10.5,11.5,14,8,13,6,15,10,11.5,10.5,12,8,16.5)
var(Xs)
sqrt(var(Xs))
```

Since we have that $Var(\bar{X}) = \frac{Var(X)}{n}$ and $n = 16$, we can estimate $Var(X)$ as
```{r}
VarX <- 16 * var(Xs)
VarX
```

Solving $\frac{Var(X)}{n} = 0.1^2$ for $n$ yields $n = \frac{Var(X)}{0.01}$. As such we need
```{r}
VarX/0.01
```
simulations.
